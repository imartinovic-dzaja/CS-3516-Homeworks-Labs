do we need to use:
Ask first about performance...

start timer B?
timer interrupt B?

does stopTimer resets the timer to 0?

can we include the line #include <sys/time.h> inside project 2 to avoid warning message?
change the compilation flag inside makefile
from: gcc –g project2.c student2.c
to: gcc –o project2 project2.c student2.c

do we have to de-allocate memory for state variables (my queue specifically)


Ask what would be a good TIMER_INCREMENT?
Ask about time between msgs parameter?

Ask about readme

Is this performance okay?
